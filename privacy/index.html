          1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT
        </h4>
        <p>We have two types of users: domain administrators and end users. The types of information that we collect differs for the different users, however every user's email address is stored.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domain Administrators:</strong> In order to function, we must store a calendar ID that can be referenced by end users. Actions taken by domain administators that impact other users are stored and a log is recorded for posterity.</li>
          <li><strong>End Users:</strong> In order to use this service, the end user must grant access to their Google Calendar through the relavent Google APIs. No information is inherently stored, however there is an option to save data to our database for the user's convenience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Error logs for all users are stored for troubleshooting.</p>

        <h4 id="who-can-access">
          2. WHO HAS ACCESS TO COLLECTED INFORMATION?
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          No information collected by this service will ever be intentionally shared with a 3rd party except where required by law. No data will ever be sold. No data will ever be used to train AI.
        </p>

          3. HOW To ACCESS TO YOUR OWN DATA?
        </h4>
        
        <p>Users interested in receiving a copy of their own data can request it by sending an email to contact@schoolcycle.app.</p>
