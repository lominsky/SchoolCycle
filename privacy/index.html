        <h4 id="how-we-collect">How we Collect and Use Information</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Domain Set Up:</b> We ask for certain information when an administrator registers with SchoolCycle. Administrators must provide a Google Calendar ID to be used as a Cycle Day Calendar. This information will be used to populate individuals’ calendars based on what day of the cycle it is. Administrators must also provide email addresses of anyone they want to be able to manage their domain’s settings, and must create at least one schedule for their domain to use as a default. Their email address may also be used to send infrequent updates about SchoolCycle. Changes to domain-wide settings are logged for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Student Registration:</b> Students may sign up for a SchoolCycle account using their Google accounts, but without a valid domain wide subscription, their accounts cannot do anything or store information. By logging in using a Google account, SchoolCycle stores the user’s email address and name. Other users are not able to see who has created an account. Certain errors will also trigger server logs for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Calendar Data:</b> The primary purpose of SchoolCycle is for students and teachers to add repeating events to their Google Calendars. It is possible to do that without SchoolCycle storing any data. The SchoolCycle client website gets a list of Google Calendars and sends updates to those calendars without sending any data to SchoolCycle servers. It is possible to store event data for later use, but that is not required for SchoolCycle functionality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Automatically Collected Data:</b> We automatically collect certain technical usage information when you use the SchoolCycle Services (“Usage Data”). Usage Data includes the information that your web browser or mobile application automatically sends to our servers whenever you visit. The Usage Data collected in our logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email. Typically, this information is collected through log files, web beacons, browser cookies, or other device identifiers that may uniquely identify your browser or device. In addition, the SchoolCycle Services may use third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, Google Analytics) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users and bugs in our Services. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user. We do not permit third party advertising networks or other third parties to collect information about your browsing behavior from our website for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h4 id="how-we-share">How we Share Your Information</h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
          SchoolCycle does not sell or rent any of your, or your child’s, personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Targeted advertising is not permitted on SchoolCycle. We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best SchoolCycle experience. More specifically, this information is used to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features</li>
          <li>Respond to your requests for information or customer support</li>
          <li>Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it</li>
          <li>Send you information about new features and SchoolCycle products we believe you may be interested in</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          We use automatically collected information (described in the “Automatically Collected Data” section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          We do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy:
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Service Providers:</b> Targeted advertising is not permitted on SchoolCycle. We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf. We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, and security. Generally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these service providers must adhere to the same standards of data privacy and security as those detailed herein, particularly with regard to protected personal information.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Analytics Services:</b> We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:</b> We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how SchoolCycle is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for SchoolCycle. Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Legal Requirements:</b> We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of SchoolCycle, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Sharing with SchoolCycle Companies:</b> Over time, SchoolCycle may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Change of Control:</b> If we sell, divest or transfer SchoolCycle or a portion of SchoolCycle, we will not transfer Student personal information without first giving you the ability to opt-out of the transfer by deleting your account, unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own. We may also transfer personal information – under the same conditions – in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.
        </p>

        <h4 id="how-we-store">How we Store and Protect Your Information</h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Storage and Processing:</b> Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Keeping Information Safe:</b> SchoolCycle maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. We use highly rated hosting providers with teams of experts dedicated to monitoring network security. Access to information is limited through user/password credentials by the administrator of the website only. When you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default. We do not store or have access to any password data.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.schoolcycle.app) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us.
        </p>
        
        <h4 id="how-to-update">How to Update or Delete Your Information</h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Account Information and Settings:</b> Schools and students may update account information, such as email, password and name, by signing emailing support@schoolcycle.app. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying account information, contact us directly at support@schoolcycle.app.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>Deleting Your Account and Information:</b> If you would like to delete your account and information from the site, please contact support@schoolcycle.app and your request will be honored within a reasonable amount of time. The request should be made from the email address associated with the account to ensure it is a legitimate request. We may maintain anonymized, aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes.
        </p>
        
        <h4 id="childrens-privacy">Children's Privacy</h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          SchoolCycle does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless and until the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. Because SchoolCycle collects and uses Student Data at the direction of and under the control of a School, SchoolCycle relies on each School to provide appropriate notice to parents of the School's use of third party service providers such as SchoolCycle, and for the Schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for SchoolCycle to collect Student Data, as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Please contact us at support@schoolcycle.app if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper consent so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.
        </p>
        
        <h4 id="changes-updates">Changes and Updates</h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
          This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected in the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. Your continued use of the SchoolCycle Services following such update constitutes your agreement to the revised Privacy Policy.
